This minimalist portfolio website is designed with simplicity in mind, featuring only two pages: the Home page and the Contact page. It aims to provide visitors with essential information about the creator and an easy way to get in touch.

Pages:
1. Home Page:
The Home page serves as an introduction to the creator. It includes a brief overview of the creator's skills, interests, and perhaps a welcome message. The design is clean and inviting, focusing on delivering a memorable first impression.

2. Contact Page:
The Contact page offers visitors a straightforward way to reach out to the creator. It typically includes a contact form or simply lists contact information such as email address, phone number, and links to social media profiles. The design emphasizes clarity and accessibility to encourage communication.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Used for structuring the content of both pages.
CSS: Used for styling and layout design, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
